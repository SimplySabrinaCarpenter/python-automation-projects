### 3. The `.gitignore` File

I **highly recommend** you include this file. It tells Git which files and folders to ignore. It's key for preventing unnecessary files, virtual environment folders, or even worse, secrets from being uploaded to the repository!

```gitignore
# .gitignore

# Python virtual environments
.venv/
venv/
env/
ENV/
*.env

# Python cache files
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd

# IDE configuration files
.vscode/
.idea/

# Files generated by the scripts
*.db
*.csv
*.md

# Local configuration files (very important for security!)
.env
config.ini
